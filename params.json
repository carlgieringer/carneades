Screen Shot of the Carneades Web App\r\n\r\n# Introducing the Carneades Web App\r\n\r\nThe latest version of Carneades is a Web application with a three-tiered\r\narchitecture consisting of a relational database backend layer, an\r\napplication logic layer and a graphical user interface layer. (The\r\nprevious version of Carneades, a desktop application called the\r\n[Carneades\r\nEditor](https://www.wuala.com/tfgordon/Public/Carneades/Releases/carneades-editor-1.0.2.jar),\r\nis still available.\r\n\r\nNew Features:\r\n\r\n-   Now a multiuser Web application, with a three-tier architecture,\r\n    including a relational database backend.\r\n-   Zero configuration and zero administration, with a built-in database\r\n    engine and web server.\r\n-   Can be used locally by a single user, without an Internet\r\n    connection.\r\n-   New argument evaluator, based on ASPIC+ and Dung abstract\r\n    argumentation frameworks. Cyclic argument graphs are now handled.\r\n-   Argument maps are now represented for the Web using Structured\r\n    Vector Graphics (SVG)\r\n-   New XML format for exporting and interchanging argument graphs,\r\n    called the Carneades Argument Format (CAF).\r\n-   New rule language, based on Lisp s-expressions, for representing\r\n    policies and argumentation schemes.\r\n\r\nCAF and the new rule language replace the use in Carneades of the Legal\r\nKnowledge Interchange Format (LKIF) from the ESTRELLA project.\r\n\r\nCarneades is open source software licensed using the\r\n[MPL-2.0](http://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-2.0) license.

Download the latest version of the `carneades-webapp.x.zip` file\r\n    from the\r\n    [releases](https://www.wuala.com/tfgordon/Public/Carneades/Releases)\r\n    folder.\r\n2.  Unzip the `carneades-webapp.x.zip` file.\r\n3.  Change to the `carneades-webapp-x` directory.\r\n4.  Double click on the `carneades-webapp.jar` file or execute the\r\n    following command line:\\\r\n     `$ java -jar carneades-webapp.jar`\r\n\r\n    **Warning:** Microsoft Windows users may need to take extra steps to\r\n    configure Java and the Carneades application. See [this\r\n    explanation](http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_programs/since-updating-to-windows-7-i-am-unable-to-run-any/b4b2c2fb-8634-4d26-bf76-a27cb7e6cbff)\r\n    from Microsoft.\r\n\r\n5.  The server will be start and open the home page of the Carneades\r\n    client in your web browser.\r\n6.  If the home page fails to open, enter this URL into the address bar\r\n    of your web browser:\\\r\n     `http://localhost:8080/carneades/#/home`\r\n7.  A list of projects should be shown. To get started, click on the\r\n    link for the \"Copyright in the Knowledge Economy\" project and follow\r\n    the instructions.\r\n8.  To shutdown the server you may need to end the Java task using your\r\n    task manager, depending on your operating system. If you started the\r\n    server from the command line, you can kill the process with\r\n    Control-C on Unix machines, including Macs. If you started the\r\n    server on a Mac by double clicking on the jar file, you can shutdown\r\n    the server by quitting the \"routes\\_selfexe\" application in the\r\n    usual way, with Command-Q.\r\n\r\n# Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nDevelopment of Carneades has been (or is being) funded in part by a\r\nnumber of projects:\r\n\r\n-   Canadian Social Science and Humanties Research Council, 2007-2009\r\n    and 2012-2017, with Douglas Walton\r\n-   [ESTRELLA](http://www.estrellaproject.org/index.php)\r\n    (IST-2004-027655)\r\n-   Google Summer of Code, 2008\r\n-   [IMPACT](http://www.policy-impact.eu) (IST-2009-247228)\r\n-   [QUALIPSO](http://cordis.europa.eu/documents/documentlibrary/101903861EN6.pdf)\r\n-   [SPOCS](http://www.eu-spocs.eu/)\r\n-   [MARKOS](http://www.markosproject.eu)\r\n-   [Policy Compass](http://policycompass.eu/the-project/)\r\n-   [EAGLE](http://www.eagle-learning.eu/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
