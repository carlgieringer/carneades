Except for "schemas.xml", the XML files in this directory are examples
argument graphs represented using the LKIF XML schema, which is the
native format of the older desktop version of Carneades, called the
Carneades Editor. (The "schemas.xml" files is for use with
[nXML](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/nxml-mode.html),
an Emacs major-mode for editing and validating XML documents.)

The Carneades Editor is still available:

1. Go to <http://carneades.github.com>
2. Click on the "Releases" link in the menu.
3. Download the "carneades-editor-1.0.2" file.
4. This is an executable Java desktop application, with a graphical
user interface.  Start the application by either double-clicking on
the file name in a GUI or by executing the following command in a
terminal:

$ java -jar carneades-editor-1.0.2

The LKIF schema can be found in the schemas directory of the Carneades
source code, in both Relax NG and XSD formats.
