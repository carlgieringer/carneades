1. Prerequisites

- PLT Scheme <http://www.plt-scheme.org>
- GraphViz <http://www.graphviz.org/>

Both are free software, available in Mac/Unix/Windows versions.

2. Downloading Carneades

Carneades is available for downloading as a compressed (.zip) file from
<http://carneades.berlios.de>.  Alternatively, the sources can be
downloaded using the SVN source code management system, following the
instructions avaiable here
<http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=9385>.

3. Installation

- If you downloaded the .zip file distribution of Carneades, first
unpack this .zip file in the directory/folder of your choice.  If you
used SVN to download Carneades, you will have downloaded them into a
directory.   No matter which method you used, in the following we will
refer to the directory containing the Carneades sources as
"CARNEADES_HOME".  (You do not need to create an environment variable
with this name.)

The CARNEADES_HOME directory should contain these files and directories:

- CHANGES.txt 
- INSTALL.txt 
- examples 
- lib 
- schemas

The Scheme source files of Carneades are in the "lib/carneades"
directory.

Define an environment variable named "PLTCOLLECTS" listing the directory
paths that PLT Scheme should search when looking for libraries.  For example, 
if the CARNEADES_HOME directory is "/usr/local/share/carneades" and the only 
other directory to be searched is PLT Scheme's default collections direction, 
PLTCOLLECTS should be set equal to ":/usr/local/share/carneades/lib".  Using 
the "bash" shell, this can be done by adding the following line to the 
.bash_profile file in your home directory:

	typeset -x PLTCOLLECTS=:/usr/local/share/carneades/lib

4. Configuration

- In the lib/carneades directory, edit the config.scm file to select your
preferred graphics format for displaying argument graphs (png, ps, or
svg) and specify the full path to some application for viewing graphics
in this format.  The config.scm file includes some examples for both
Windows and Mac OS X.


5. Trying it out

- Start PLT Scheme.  Warning: You may need to start PLT Scheme from a 
  terminal program in order for the PLTCOLLECTS variable to
  be defined in the environment used by PLT Scheme.  If the Carneades
  source files are not found when running the examples, this may be the 
  problem.  Evaluate the following Scheme expression in PLT Scheme to 
  check whether PLTCOLLECTS includes the carneades/lib directory:
  	
  	(getenv "PLTCOLLECTS")
  		
- In the "examples" directory, open the "rule-tests.scm" file 
- Click on the "Run" button in the upper-right corner of the window 
  to run some tests 
- Try out the example commands commented out near the end of the file, 
  to see how to ask queries and show a diagram of the arguments found.

Note: You will need to quit the graphics application to return control
to PLT Scheme.
