1. Prerequisites

- PLT Scheme (http://www.plt-scheme.org)
- GraphViz (http://www.graphviz.org/)

Both are free software, available in Mac/Unix/Windows versions.

2. Installation

- Unpack the attached carneades.zip file in some directory/folder of your choice. This will create a directory named "dist", with the following subdirectories:

	- src: The Scheme source files
	- examples:  Some examples

3. Configuration

In the src directory, edit the config.scm file to select your preferred graphics format for displaying 
argument graphs (png, ps, or svg) and specify the full path to some application for viewing graphics in 
this format.  The config.scm file includes some examples for both Windows and Mac OS X.

4. Trying it out

- Start PLT Scheme
- In the "examples" directory, open the "rule-tests.scm" file
- Click on the "Run" button in the upper-right corner of the window to run some tests
- Try out the example commands commented out near the end of the file, to see how to ask queries and 
  show a diagram of the arguments found.

Note: You will need to quit the graphics application to return control to PLT Scheme.
