# Introduction

The Carneades argumentation system is open source software, freely
available for downloading at <http://carneades.github.com>.

Carneades provides web-based, collaborative software tools for:

- (re)constructing arguments using a rulebase of argumentation schemes
- visualizing arguments in diagrams (argument maps)
- critically evaluating arguments, using a formal model of structured
  argument based on argumentation schemes and Dung abstract
  argumentation frameworks
- serializing and interchanging arguments using our own Carneades
  Argument Format (CAF) as well as the Argument Interchange Format
  (AIF)

The next chapter, Getting Started, explains how to download, install
and run the Carneades system locally on your personal computer. The
projects chapter explains how to create and access projects, where
each project can contain any number of argument graphs. The argument
graph chapter provides an overview of the underlying data model used
by all the tools. The browsing, visualization and evaluation chapter
explains how to read and view argument graphs. The chapters on editing
argument graphs and modeling argumentation schemes are somewhat more
demanding and some basic prior knowledge of argumentation theory
[@Walton:2006] is recommended. The system administration chapter
describes how to build and install the system from its source files,
as well as how to configure the system. The final chapter shows how
some well-known argumentation schemes [@Walton:2008] can been
represented using the system.
