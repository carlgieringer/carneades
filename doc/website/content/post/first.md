title = "New Carneades Web Site and Blog using Hugo"

+++

The Carneades Web site is now generated using the [Hugo Website
Engine](http://hugo.spf13.com/) and hosted on GitHub.  Hugo provides a
nice way to maintain a blog. We will use this feature to make
announcements about the Carneades system.  The blog is available in
the Atom syndication format [here](/post/index.xml).
